# Expo Go Crash with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a bug where using certain libraries that rely on native modules in an Expo app causes crashes within Expo Go.  The error messages are often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Problem
When attempting to use a library like `react-native-camera` in an Expo project, the application might fail to load or crash silently within Expo Go.  This is often due to the incompatibility between the native module requirements and the Expo Go environment.  The error messages may lack specifics, increasing the time spent debugging. 

## Solution
The primary solution usually involves using an Expo-compatible alternative or building a standalone app to bypass the limitations of Expo Go.  Consider using Expo's managed workflow with its built-in support or carefully selecting libraries that provide compatibility with both managed and bare workflows.   Proper dependency management and configuration can minimize such issues.  If a suitable alternative is unavailable, a bare workflow is usually needed to fully utilize native modules.
