To resolve this issue, consider the following strategies:

1. **Use Expo-compatible alternatives:**  Search for libraries that have been explicitly designed to work within the Expo managed workflow.  Many libraries offer managed workflow support, eliminating the issues caused by native modules. For example, if using `react-native-camera`, explore Expo's camera APIs or an alternative library compatible with Expo.

2. **Eject to a bare workflow:**  If a suitable Expo-compatible alternative is unavailable, you may need to eject your project from the Expo managed workflow to a bare React Native workflow. This allows direct interaction with native modules but requires a deeper understanding of native module integration and compilation.  It increases build complexity.

3. **Ensure correct dependencies:** Verify that all your dependencies are compatible with each other and with your chosen Expo SDK version.  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze dependency trees and identify potential conflicts.

4. **Standalone build:**  Build a standalone app (IPA for iOS, APK for Android) to test your application. This bypasses Expo Go and enables better understanding of the issue, as it would likely run normally in a standalone version if the native module was the cause of the problem in Expo Go. 

**Example using Expo Camera API (instead of react-native-camera):**

```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

// ... rest of the component
```
