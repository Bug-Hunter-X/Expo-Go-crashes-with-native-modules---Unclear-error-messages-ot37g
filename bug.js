This bug occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an application that uses a library that requires native modules.  The app may crash or fail to load, especially if the native module is not properly configured or if there is a mismatch in dependencies.  The error messages are often vague and don't provide enough information to track down the problem.  Specifically, the application might attempt to import the native module, but the Expo Go environment might not support it, leading to silent failures or runtime crashes.

Example (using react-native-camera):
```javascript
import { Camera } from 'react-native-camera';

// ... rest of the component
```
This import might work on a built standalone app but fail in Expo Go.
